# House Prices-Advanced Regression Techniques

## Aim of the project

In this Kaggle competition the aim is to predict the prices of residential properties in Ames, Iowa. The dataset used was the Ames Housing dataset, which can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data.

## Algorithms 

In my attempt to solve this problem i used a Random Forest and a Ridge Regression model, both of which can be found in this repo.

## Credits

Again, in order to develop my Jupyter notebooks i was inspired by other Kagglers that took part in this competition!
